# My Smart Kitchen (Title's not my favorite... can be changed!)

This idea furthers some already available concepts in a Samsung smart refrigerator, and they may already be available in competitors. This started out as a recipe generator for my keto diet because it's tough to constantly come up with recipes. I wanted to write a program that took in just the String/names of various recipes and spit out 7 breakfasts, 7 lunches, and 7 dinners. That expanded into a place to store recipes where you can add/modify/delete ingredients and instructions.

Now it's expanding a little more to be able to tell you what recipes you can make with the ingredients you input into the "Pantry". The project has begun to take shape but it is FAR from complete.

The project is being coded in Java on the command line, currently, and I would like to make it smartphone app starting on Android first, with the potential to integrate to certain proprietary hardwares as the project becomes more and more real-world!

# What I'm working on currently

I've got a list of milestones, and am really only hitting the very beginning of the project. Some Java classes are written, but they need to be expanded or extended. I'm currently inputting things through the Main function, and don't even have an 'Add/Modify/Delete' function yet... but they're coming! That's what this is all about, Version Control!

I want to make sure I don't mess up the next phases of the project because it's starting to get a little big & complicated for an advanced beginner like myself.

# I'd love ideas! I'm looking to collaborate and even expand this to a sellable product in the future.

I come from entrepreneurship and know this could be an amazing product if it's built properly! Whether it gets sold to Samsung for a future smart refrigerator because it does things better, or it gets utilized in a special piece of hardware on it's own. Constructive feedback is appreciated! Reach out if you have any thoughts, and I don't even think anyone will be monitoring this, but oh well. I'd like to have fun building it, and it's really just for me anyway =]
